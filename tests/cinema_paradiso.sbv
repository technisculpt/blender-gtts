0:3:14.708, 0:3:19.0
Yes, Salvatore. Salvatore DE Vita.

0:3:21.708, 0:3:24.125
What do you mean you don't know him?

0:3:25.500, 0:3:28.416
Yes, that's it. I'm his mother.

0:3:29.166, 0:3:32.875
I'm calling from Sicily, the whole blessed day.

0:3:36.666, 0:3:38.583
I see, not there.

0:3:41.875, 0:3:44.250
Then please, can you tell me...

0:3:47.583, 0:3:51.625
656-220-56.

0:3:52.166, 0:3:54.291
Thank you. Good-bye.

0:3:59.541, 0:4:2.125
Mama, it's useless to call.

0:4:1.666, 0:4:4.666
He's a busy man, could be anywhere.

0:4:4.333, 0:4:6.458
He won't remember anymore.

0:4:7.708, 0:4:9.791
Come on, let it go.

0:4:9.958, 0:4:13.0
He hasn't been here in 30 years.

0:4:15.0, 0:4:16.958
You know how he is.

0:4:19.625, 0:4:21.0
He'll remember.

0:4:21.125, 0:4:25.83
I'm sure he'll remember. I know him better than you.

0:4:25.458, 0:4:30.250
If he finds out later we didn't tell him, he'll be angry.

0:4:31.666, 0:4:35.458
I'd like to talk to Mr. Salvatore DE Vita.

0:4:36.333, 0:4:37.625
I'm his mother.

0:5:43.333, 0:5:44.875
Salvatore...

0:5:46.41, 0:5:47.500
what time is it?

0:5:49.500, 0:5:50.791
Very late.

0:5:54.250, 0:5:57.916
I'm sorry. There was no way to let you know.

0:6:0.583, 0:6:2.208
Go back to sleep.

0:6:6.708, 0:6:8.250
Your mother called.

0:6:10.375, 0:6:12.958
She took me for someone else.

0:6:14.166, 0:6:15.750
What'd you tell her?

0:6:16.41, 0:6:19.583
I played along.I didn't want to disappoint her.

0:6:19.333, 0:6:21.250
We had a long talk.

0:6:23.0, 0:6:26.750
She said you haven't visited her in 30 years.

0:6:25.958, 0:6:29.500
When she wants to see you, she comes to Rome.

0:6:29.166, 0:6:31.458
She called just to say that?

0:6:36.375, 0:6:37.125
No.

0:6:38.125, 0:6:42.333
She said someone's died... someone named Alfredo.

0:6:43.500, 0:6:45.458
The funeral is tomorrow.

0:6:46.791, 0:6:48.916
Who is he, a relative?

0:6:51.791, 0:6:53.791
No. Go to sleep.

0:8:9.291, 0:8:13.583
The boy will be my death. How can I say Mass?

0:8:12.916, 0:8:20.83
Lord God, we ask you to be pleased with the sacrifice we offer you with humble and contrite heart.

0:8:18.250, 0:8:19.416
Cleanse...

0:8:24.166, 0:8:25.333
Cleanse...

0:8:26.666, 0:8:27.708
Toto!

0:8:30.458, 0:8:32.625
Cleanse me from my sin.

0:8:40.291, 0:8:41.916
Better late than never.

0:8:42.833, 0:8:48.125
How often must I say it? Without the bell, I lose my place.

0:8:47.458, 0:8:51.541
Always sleeping. What do you do at night, eat?

0:8:51.750, 0:8:55.625
Father, at my house we don't even eat at noon.

0:8:56.208, 0:9:0.250
The veterinarian says so. That's why I'm tired.

0:8:59.791, 0:9:3.625
I know why you're tired. Don't think I don't.

0:9:3.666, 0:9:7.250
Now run along home. I've something to do.

0:9:7.208, 0:9:10.125
- Can I come? - No, you cannot.

0:9:9.250, 0:9:12.500
- Yes, yes! - Toto, out!

0:9:12.166, 0:9:14.583
I want to! I want to!

0:9:25.458, 0:9:26.750
Alfredo.

0:9:28.875, 0:9:30.166
Alfredo!

0:9:31.583, 0:9:32.625
Yes!

0:9:32.583, 0:9:34.41
You can start.

0:9:46.791, 0:9:48.416
Here we go again.

0:9:59.208, 0:10:0.291
The frame!

0:10:33.458, 0:10:36.416
Pepe, one day we'll have it all.

0:10:37.666, 0:10:39.583
We'll go away together...

0:10:41.375, 0:10:43.166
live the easy life...

0:10:43.666, 0:10:45.833
where no one knows us.

0:10:46.208, 0:10:47.291
Forget it.

0:10:49.500, 0:10:51.666
You don't love me anymore.

0:12:12.625, 0:12:13.458
Never!

0:12:44.833, 0:12:47.291
One pair, two pairs!

0:12:47.791, 0:12:50.750
100 lire! Real nylon!

0:13:7.166, 0:13:8.958
You mustn't come here.

0:13:9.750, 0:13:13.958
I told you and told you... like talking to a wall.

0:13:12.916, 0:13:15.250
If the film catches fire...

0:13:15.333, 0:13:18.291
little as you are, you'll go up... boom!

0:13:18.500, 0:13:21.291
"And turn into a chunk of charcoal."

0:13:24.166, 0:13:26.666
Like to wag your tongue, eh?

0:13:27.291, 0:13:29.791
One day, I'll cut it off.

0:13:31.375, 0:13:32.500
Like that.

0:13:47.41, 0:13:48.250
Can I have it?

0:13:49.583, 0:13:51.708
Come on, can I have it?

0:13:53.291, 0:13:55.458
- Well, can I? - No!

0:13:58.583, 0:14:0.250
Deaf as a post!

0:14:0.250, 0:14:4.125
I have to splice it back before I return the film.

0:14:4.291, 0:14:6.83
What a pest you are!

0:14:7.125, 0:14:11.41
Why didn't you splice these when you gave the films back?

0:14:14.500, 0:14:19.583
Sometimes I can't find the right place, so they stay here.

0:14:19.250, 0:14:21.958
Anyway, they kiss too much.

0:14:22.958, 0:14:24.708
Then I can have them.

0:14:25.416, 0:14:28.125
No. Now look, come here.

0:14:30.0, 0:14:33.666
Before I kick your fanny, I'll make you a deal.

0:14:33.41, 0:14:35.666
All those are yours... a present.

0:14:36.41, 0:14:37.125
Thanks.

0:14:37.500, 0:14:43.375
But one, you keep out of here, and two, they stay with me. Got it?

0:14:41.958, 0:14:43.125
All right.

0:14:43.458, 0:14:47.0
Right. Then we agree. Now scram.

0:14:58.250, 0:15:0.583
What kind of a deal is that?

0:15:0.291, 0:15:3.41
If they're mine, how come you keep them?

0:15:8.250, 0:15:11.125
Don't come back, or I'll thrash you!

0:15:20.125, 0:15:22.625
"Shoot first, think later."

0:15:21.625, 0:15:25.416
"This is no job for weaklings, traitorous dog."

0:15:31.333, 0:15:36.458
"Hey, you! Dirty swine, hands off that gold!"

0:15:39.541, 0:15:42.666
"Black hearted pig, stay away from me...

0:15:44.166, 0:15:46.583
or I'll smash your face in."

0:16:4.166, 0:16:8.916
Mama, the war's over, but... why doesn't Papa come back?

0:16:9.791, 0:16:14.41
He'll come back, you'll see. One of these days.

0:16:15.166, 0:16:16.875
I don't remember him.

0:16:17.875, 0:16:19.125
Where's Russia?

0:16:20.208, 0:16:23.875
It takes years to get there and years to come back.

0:16:26.791, 0:16:29.41
Go to bed. It's late.

0:17:5.208, 0:17:8.166
You can hoodwink your mother, but not me!

0:17:9.583, 0:17:14.166
Get your diploma and join the police! Lazybones!

0:17:13.875, 0:17:17.291
Good-for-nothing! Get in there and study!

0:17:21.41, 0:17:24.500
Well? How much is 5 times 5?

0:17:27.541, 0:17:28.541
30.

0:17:36.208, 0:17:37.541
Silence!

0:17:37.750, 0:17:40.166
Table of 5's, dimwit.

0:17:40.250, 0:17:42.750
1 times 5 is 5...

0:17:42.458, 0:17:44.916
2 times 5 is 10...

0:17:45.250, 0:17:48.41
3 times 5 is 15...

0:17:47.833, 0:17:50.458
4 times 5 is 20...

0:17:50.541, 0:17:52.375
5 times 5?

0:17:54.166, 0:17:55.166
40.

0:18:4.958, 0:18:6.291
Silence!

0:18:8.958, 0:18:9.875
Boccia...

0:18:11.291, 0:18:12.625
25.

0:18:13.416, 0:18:16.875
Learn your tables, or you'll never get a job.

0:18:18.250, 0:18:19.916
For the last time...

0:18:20.375, 0:18:22.666
what is 5 times 5?

0:18:23.125, 0:18:24.375
Christmas!

0:18:57.250, 0:19:0.666
I paid to get in. I'm seeing the movie.

0:19:1.166, 0:19:3.708
Get down from there, you devil.

0:19:4.541, 0:19:6.625
Go back to your seat.

0:19:6.541, 0:19:10.416
Worse than rabbits. They're all over the place.

0:19:10.875, 0:19:12.541
Little monsters.

0:19:22.250, 0:19:23.958
I'm off to Oregon.

0:19:23.750, 0:19:26.125
Wait for me at my ranch.

0:19:26.958, 0:19:28.916
Wait for a dead man?

0:19:29.166, 0:19:31.250
A star-studded cast...

0:19:31.958, 0:19:33.916
featuring John Wayne...

0:19:33.666, 0:19:34.875
Claire Trevor...

0:19:48.583, 0:19:50.458
Hello, everyone!

0:19:50.875, 0:19:54.416
- Can't I say hello? - Double feature today.

0:19:53.708, 0:19:56.41
So? I'm here to sleep.

0:19:57.166, 0:20:0.125
- What's your smoke? - Americans.

0:20:3.958, 0:20:6.458
Cut the news, Alfredo!

0:20:11.875, 0:20:14.791
The men and women who fought in secret...

0:20:15.916, 0:20:19.166
brave guerrillas, reunited in Rome...

0:20:19.83, 0:20:21.625
for the first Resistance Rally.

0:21:5.41, 0:21:6.541
What does it say?

0:21:6.333, 0:21:7.666
I'm illiterate.

0:21:8.583, 0:21:9.833
You, too?

0:21:20.41, 0:21:22.625
Twelve hours of blood and sweat...

0:21:23.125, 0:21:26.750
to bring home barely enough to keep from starving.

0:21:29.416, 0:21:30.916
Yet their nets...

0:21:31.708, 0:21:34.166
when they pulled them up, were full.

0:22:15.833, 0:22:16.916
I knew it!

0:22:18.958, 0:22:23.208
Twenty years I've gone to movies and never saw a kiss.

0:22:23.875, 0:22:25.208
And when will we?

0:22:29.583, 0:22:31.166
Kiss my ass!

0:23:22.41, 0:23:25.500
- Don Vincenzo. - You and you, to work.

0:23:25.125, 0:23:26.416
What about me?

0:23:27.166, 0:23:29.583
Go get a job from Stalin.

0:23:29.958, 0:23:33.666
His day will come, even here. You watch.

0:23:34.666, 0:23:37.0
I always get left out.

0:23:37.291, 0:23:40.833
Good movie. The kid really acted well.

0:23:40.833, 0:23:43.541
Too bad he was so unlucky.

0:23:42.666, 0:23:45.291
What a jackass to buy that boat.

0:23:45.875, 0:23:48.416
Idiot, you didn't get it at all.

0:23:50.458, 0:23:54.166
Right, boys, you work from dawn to dusk.

0:23:55.750, 0:23:58.625
And don't ask how much it pays.

0:24:6.333, 0:24:7.166
Mama.

0:24:27.583, 0:24:30.458
I waited all day. You got milk?

0:24:30.500, 0:24:31.250
No.

0:24:31.750, 0:24:32.708
The money?

0:24:35.250, 0:24:36.416
Stolen.

0:24:38.166, 0:24:40.458
You spent it on movies?

0:24:43.125, 0:24:45.541
Movies, always movies!

0:24:48.750, 0:24:50.958
Signora Maria, wait.

0:24:50.416, 0:24:53.125
Leave him alone. Go easy.

0:24:54.458, 0:24:57.83
And you, why do you tell lies?

0:24:57.458, 0:24:59.541
You know you got in free.

0:25:1.0, 0:25:2.333
Tell your mother.

0:25:2.541, 0:25:5.250
Maybe he lost the money inside.

0:25:4.958, 0:25:7.416
- How much? - 50 lire.

0:25:9.291, 0:25:12.458
What'd you find tonight, under the seats?

0:25:17.500, 0:25:18.500
A comb.

0:25:23.250, 0:25:24.958
Two shoe lifts.

0:25:27.958, 0:25:30.333
- Can of tobacco... - And?

0:25:31.0, 0:25:32.333
50 lire.

0:25:40.0, 0:25:40.916
See?

0:25:42.500, 0:25:44.541
Thank you, Alfredo.

0:25:46.83, 0:25:47.708
- Good-bye. - Bye.

0:25:48.250, 0:25:49.333
See you.

0:25:57.416, 0:25:59.500
I understood right away.

0:25:59.958, 0:26:3.41
The square is mine! It's my square!

0:26:7.125, 0:26:9.541
It's midnight. Midnight!

0:26:9.333, 0:26:13.125
Out! Shoo! I have to close the square.

0:27:6.458, 0:27:9.250
Hard on the feet, eh, Father?

0:27:10.125, 0:27:14.125
Going, it's all downhill and all the saints help out.

0:27:13.583, 0:27:16.791
But coming back, the saints just watch.

0:27:18.208, 0:27:20.0
If that's God's will.

0:27:20.375, 0:27:21.958
See you tonight.

0:27:29.0, 0:27:30.166
What's wrong?

0:27:30.583, 0:27:32.375
Your foot this time.

0:27:34.333, 0:27:37.333
Always something. What can we do?

0:27:40.750, 0:27:43.625
Alfredo, did you know my father?

0:27:43.958, 0:27:47.166
What a question. And how I knew him.

0:27:46.750, 0:27:51.500
Tall, thin, jolly, with a nice mustache like me.

0:27:51.625, 0:27:55.500
Always smiling. A lot like Clark Gable.

0:27:55.708, 0:27:58.916
Now that I'm older and go to fifth grade...

0:28:0.333, 0:28:3.166
I don't say I should come in the booth...

0:28:3.500, 0:28:6.208
but can't we at least be friends?

0:28:6.875, 0:28:11.458
"I choose my friends for looks, my enemies for intelligence."

0:28:11.916, 0:28:14.708
You're too foxy to be my friend.

0:28:16.208, 0:28:18.666
I always tell my children...

0:28:18.125, 0:28:21.208
"Be careful how you choose your friends."

0:28:21.458, 0:28:23.750
You haven't got any children.

0:28:26.208, 0:28:28.625
When I do, I'll tell them.

0:28:33.791, 0:28:37.375
Don't cry, don't cry. It's all right.

0:28:37.666, 0:28:41.166
The fire's out. It's over. I'm here.

0:28:42.833, 0:28:44.83
What happened?

0:28:44.416, 0:28:45.458
Monster!

0:28:46.541, 0:28:49.625
Your little sister could've burned to death.

0:28:49.458, 0:28:51.41
And all your fault!

0:28:56.125, 0:29:1.125
I told you not to keep your film under the bed by the fire pan.

0:29:0.208, 0:29:2.500
Even the photographs burned!

0:29:12.875, 0:29:15.583
Nearly set fire to the house.

0:29:16.791, 0:29:19.333
You and your stupid movies!

0:29:21.416, 0:29:24.750
Aren't you ashamed at your age to play with a boy?

0:29:25.416, 0:29:28.125
Why look at me? What did I do?

0:29:28.250, 0:29:30.208
Who gave him the film?

0:29:32.0, 0:29:36.291
Don't do it again. He goes crazy. Crazy!

0:29:35.166, 0:29:38.416
All I hear is movies, Alfredo.

0:29:36.958, 0:29:39.250
Alfredo, movies!

0:29:40.83, 0:29:43.666
Swear you won't let him in again. Swear it!

0:29:45.625, 0:29:47.166
You have my word.

0:29:51.250, 0:29:52.958
God grant me this.

0:29:52.708, 0:29:55.458
Send your father home to whip you!

0:29:55.833, 0:29:59.83
Papa won't come back, and I know why.

0:29:59.291, 0:30:0.458
He's dead.

0:30:1.833, 0:30:3.375
That's not true.

0:30:5.625, 0:30:8.250
You'll see, he'll come back.

0:30:31.916, 0:30:34.125
They smoke like chimneys.

0:30:42.833, 0:30:45.125
No. Go buy a ticket.

0:30:53.250, 0:30:54.83
No!

0:31:5.958, 0:31:7.250
What was that?

0:31:9.125, 0:31:12.875
I'll make mincemeat of you! You'll reckon with me!

0:31:26.916, 0:31:28.416
Signora Anna!

0:31:48.458, 0:31:49.750
Alfredo.

0:31:50.41, 0:31:54.375
Don't blame me. Your wife told me to bring your lunch.

0:31:55.458, 0:31:58.750
I told my mother you didn't give me the film.

0:32:0.41, 0:32:1.750
It wasn't your fault.

0:32:1.750, 0:32:5.458
I thought it was a joke about film catching fire.

0:32:6.750, 0:32:10.291
I just wanted to tell you. Now I'll go.

0:32:11.958, 0:32:13.750
Toto, come here.

0:32:17.291, 0:32:19.750
Come on, come sit down.

0:32:23.83, 0:32:27.375
Now listen. I got into this business at age ten.

0:32:27.958, 0:32:31.541
Back then, we didn't have fancy machines.

0:32:32.375, 0:32:34.208
Movies were silent.

0:32:34.833, 0:32:37.500
You turned the projector by hand...

0:32:37.458, 0:32:38.666
with a crank.

0:32:39.83, 0:32:41.0
The whole livelong day!

0:32:41.250, 0:32:44.41
And it was hard, that damn crank.

0:32:45.125, 0:32:48.125
If you got tired and slowed down a bit...

0:32:50.291, 0:32:53.375
like a shot, whom, everything burned.

0:32:56.41, 0:32:58.125
So why not teach me?

0:32:58.541, 0:33:1.833
Now that there's no crank and it's dead easy.

0:33:2.500, 0:33:4.541
Because I don't want to.

0:33:5.750, 0:33:8.250
It's no kind of job for you.

0:33:8.541, 0:33:10.250
You're like a slave...

0:33:10.916, 0:33:12.583
and always alone.

0:33:12.958, 0:33:18.83
You see a film 100 times. You've nothing else to do.

0:33:16.500, 0:33:20.833
You talk to Garbo and Tyrone Power like a loony bird.

0:33:20.625, 0:33:22.708
You work like a burro.

0:33:22.750, 0:33:26.250
Even holidays... Easter, Christmas.

0:33:26.791, 0:33:29.500
You only get Good Friday off.

0:33:29.500, 0:33:32.875
And if they hadn't stuck Christ on a cross...

0:33:33.166, 0:33:34.958
we'd even work then.

0:33:35.708, 0:33:38.541
So why don't you change jobs?

0:33:45.541, 0:33:47.250
Because I'm a nitwit.

0:33:49.625, 0:33:52.750
Who else around here could run a projector?

0:33:53.375, 0:33:56.958
Nobody. It takes an imbecile like me.

0:33:59.416, 0:34:1.541
And I never had any luck.

0:34:1.958, 0:34:6.791
So! Want to be a stick-in-the-mud like me? How about it?

0:34:9.41, 0:34:10.916
Atta boy, Toto.

0:34:12.500, 0:34:15.208
I only tell you for your own good.

0:34:15.583, 0:34:20.666
Cooped up here. Suffocate in summer, freeze to death in winter.

0:34:20.583, 0:34:22.250
Breathing fumes.

0:34:22.791, 0:34:24.958
And you earn chicken feed.

0:34:26.125, 0:34:28.541
Don't you like anything about it?

0:34:28.958, 0:34:31.41
Oh, it grows on you.

0:34:30.958, 0:34:32.916
Sometimes you listen...

0:34:33.0, 0:34:35.416
and the house is full of people...

0:34:35.291, 0:34:37.41
giggling and laughing.

0:34:37.625, 0:34:39.416
Then you're happy too.

0:34:40.41, 0:34:42.666
It makes you feel good to hear them.

0:34:42.916, 0:34:45.750
Like you're the one who made them laugh...

0:34:46.500, 0:34:49.250
who made them forget their troubles.

0:34:51.83, 0:34:52.833
That part I like.

0:35:3.708, 0:35:7.458
I might as well speak Greek! What're you up to?

0:35:8.500, 0:35:11.708
Pretend to listen, then play the clown!

0:35:12.208, 0:35:15.500
Your mother's right! You're a scatterbrain!

0:35:17.0, 0:35:20.875
How'd the rascal do it? He learned by watching.

0:35:23.416, 0:35:26.458
I'm telling the manager not to let you in!

0:35:27.875, 0:35:33.291
And I'll see Father Adelfio! No more altar boy! Finished!

0:35:34.41, 0:35:35.333
Alfredo!

0:35:36.416, 0:35:37.708
Up yours!

0:35:46.83, 0:35:50.291
I got it! I won! I won the football lottery!

0:35:57.583, 0:36:0.83
The Neapolitan won the lottery!

0:36:2.625, 0:36:6.41
Hey, Ciccio from Naples won the lottery!

0:36:8.541, 0:36:11.583
Always the northerners who hit it lucky.

0:36:46.375, 0:36:49.208
The square is mine! All mine!

0:36:52.458, 0:36:55.750
Hold still! Horseflies bothering you?

0:36:57.375, 0:37:0.0
You got a lice factory up here.

0:36:59.750, 0:37:0.666
Beat it.

0:37:16.708, 0:37:19.83
What're you after? A smack?

0:37:18.666, 0:37:20.41
Get out of here.

0:37:30.0, 0:37:32.708
A merchant owns two stores.

0:37:36.291, 0:37:38.750
In one, he sells fruit.

0:37:41.125, 0:37:42.333
Be seated.

0:37:42.875, 0:37:44.0
Professor...

0:37:44.500, 0:37:48.708
the auditors taking the exam for the grade school diploma.

0:37:54.958, 0:37:56.291
Silence!

0:39:49.458, 0:39:51.250
Rotten little stinker.

0:39:52.833, 0:39:55.916
- Toto, help me. - Silence!

0:39:56.916, 0:39:59.250
I can't do this damn thing.

0:40:12.500, 0:40:13.541
Toto!

0:40:37.708, 0:40:38.625
O.K.

0:41:20.916, 0:41:23.0
Francesco Messana...

0:41:23.291, 0:41:25.0
you're under arrest.

0:41:29.625, 0:41:31.0
Good riddance!

0:41:40.958, 0:41:43.916
Kiss my ass! Pencil pusher!

0:41:44.208, 0:41:47.125
Right here is where it can catch fire.

0:41:47.291, 0:41:52.708
If it does, cut here and here, or the whole reel will burn. Got it?

0:41:52.458, 0:41:54.750
Yes. Alfredo.

0:41:58.750, 0:42:1.625
Never. We'll never have that here.

0:42:2.791, 0:42:5.250
Which side is the gelatin on?

0:42:6.916, 0:42:8.458
It tastes good.

0:42:18.791, 0:42:22.833
Shipping invoice for the film. Always keep them.

0:42:23.541, 0:42:25.416
I will, Alfredo.

0:42:25.333, 0:42:26.958
Don't ever forget.

0:42:45.250, 0:42:49.375
This is for you. Today you load the reels yourself.

0:42:51.291, 0:42:54.791
- It's so high! - Now you can run it alone.

0:42:55.291, 0:42:56.375
Hold it.

0:43:1.500, 0:43:3.791
- What a build! - My turn!

0:43:4.500, 0:43:8.958
Say good-bye to Peppino. He's leaving for Germany.

0:43:17.250, 0:43:19.541
Why don't you say good-bye?

0:43:20.41, 0:43:22.791
My father says he's a communist.

0:43:23.583, 0:43:25.583
God keep you, Mama.

0:43:25.583, 0:43:28.500
Will he really find work in Germany?

0:43:28.0, 0:43:31.125
You never know. Like playing the lottery...

0:43:31.208, 0:43:32.708
you live on hope.

0:43:34.500, 0:43:36.291
Screw this country!

0:43:37.666, 0:43:41.83
Go work in Germany, you and your Stalin.

0:43:42.125, 0:43:43.791
Good-bye, Mama.

0:43:45.83, 0:43:48.583
Good-bye, Peppino! Come back soon!

0:43:48.958, 0:43:50.416
We'll see you.

0:43:51.708, 0:43:52.750
Good-bye!

0:43:56.500, 0:43:59.875
Lucky thing Germany is closer than Russia.

0:44:4.166, 0:44:7.916
After six years, the return of spring fashion.

0:44:7.250, 0:44:8.916
Fresh and breezy...

0:44:10.83, 0:44:13.291
unlike the pompous styles of wartime.

0:44:28.625, 0:44:30.750
I'll make mincemeat of you!

0:44:30.875, 0:44:32.500
"You'll reckon with me!"

0:44:52.41, 0:44:53.958
Another sad page...

0:44:54.166, 0:44:56.916
in the tragedy of our men in Russia.

0:44:56.833, 0:44:58.750
The Defense Ministry...

0:44:58.583, 0:45:1.875
has released a new list of Italian dead...

0:45:1.750, 0:45:4.208
until now considered missing.

0:45:4.708, 0:45:9.41
The names will be posted by local military authorities.

0:45:9.541, 0:45:12.666
Families concerned will be notified.

0:45:18.41, 0:45:21.208
However, we don't know where he's buried.

0:45:21.916, 0:45:25.625
Here's the pension form. Sign it, please.

0:47:45.333, 0:47:49.291
Out! Go home! We can't have another show!

0:47:48.666, 0:47:53.125
It's late. Be reasonable. We can't show it again!

0:47:55.666, 0:47:58.458
Some peoples at through it twice!

0:48:1.208, 0:48:3.500
We've been waiting for an hour!

0:48:9.583, 0:48:12.208
Tomorrow we'll have another movie.

0:48:13.0, 0:48:16.750
A western. Word of Honor! Go home to bed.

0:48:20.916, 0:48:25.416
They'll wreck the Paradiso! All hell will break loose!

0:48:27.666, 0:48:30.83
Alfredo, let us in!

0:48:30.708, 0:48:32.41
What can I do?

0:48:34.41, 0:48:36.791
I've been waiting for three hours!

0:48:38.250, 0:48:40.0
"A mob doesn't think.

0:48:41.375, 0:48:43.666
It has a mind of its own."

0:48:44.750, 0:48:47.958
Spencer Tracy said that in "Fury."

0:48:49.0, 0:48:51.125
Well, what do you say?

0:48:52.83, 0:48:55.333
Shall we let the poor devils see their film?

0:48:57.250, 0:48:59.666
Fantastic. But how?

0:49:2.458, 0:49:7.0
"If you have no faith in me, have faith in what you see."

0:49:7.500, 0:49:10.250
Now get your fanny off that stool.

0:49:14.333, 0:49:15.500
Get ready.

0:49:17.750, 0:49:19.125
Abracadabra...

0:49:22.416, 0:49:24.750
and we pass through walls.

0:49:59.458, 0:50:1.500
Go look out the window.

0:50:7.250, 0:50:9.583
Alfredo, it's beautiful.

0:50:10.916, 0:50:13.291
Over there! It's the movie!

0:50:17.208, 0:50:19.250
Bravo, Alfredo.

0:50:23.541, 0:50:25.583
Thank you, Alfredo!

0:50:32.958, 0:50:34.416
What's going on?

0:50:37.250, 0:50:38.583
It's a movie!

0:50:42.41, 0:50:43.458
To hell with you.

0:50:50.541, 0:50:52.166
There's no sound!

0:50:53.250, 0:50:55.291
Shall we make them happy?

0:51:29.375, 0:51:30.875
Want to go down?

0:51:32.333, 0:51:33.416
Go on.

0:51:50.458, 0:51:51.916
- Look. - Good Lord.

0:51:58.458, 0:52:1.208
And Nunzio, half price.

0:52:13.625, 0:52:16.500
Have to buy tickets, folks.

0:52:20.166, 0:52:21.791
Reduced rates.

0:52:21.458, 0:52:25.291
Up yours! The square belongs to everyone!

0:52:24.958, 0:52:26.250
Oh, no!

0:52:26.583, 0:52:31.583
The square is mine! Don't joke about that! It makes me mad!

0:54:11.583, 0:54:12.875
Alfredo!

0:55:15.83, 0:55:18.416
Alfredo! No! Alfredo!

0:55:22.583, 0:55:26.458
Alfredo, Alfredo. Help! Help!

0:55:28.125, 0:55:30.375
Alfredo, Alfredo!

0:55:32.458, 0:55:33.333
Help!

0:55:45.958, 0:55:48.791
Poor Alfredo. What a shame.

0:55:52.708, 0:55:53.916
All burned!

0:55:58.0, 0:55:59.666
It all burned down!

0:56:16.250, 0:56:17.958
What do we do now?

0:56:18.500, 0:56:22.0
We have no more entertainment. Nothing.

0:56:22.333, 0:56:24.916
Where'll we get the money to rebuild?

0:56:27.833, 0:56:32.916
Take a look at Ciccio. So spiffy, you'd hardly know him.

0:56:31.666, 0:56:33.958
Who has that kind of money?

0:56:43.333, 0:56:45.625
The new Cinema Paradiso!

0:56:49.625, 0:56:51.583
Come in, come in.

0:57:21.958, 0:57:24.41
This theater is for you!

0:57:32.708, 0:57:36.166
He's just a boy. What about labor laws?

0:57:36.291, 0:57:39.250
I got the license through connections.

0:57:40.166, 0:57:43.83
Don't ask me how their minds work.

0:57:42.541, 0:57:47.750
Officially, I'm the projectionist, but the money goes to Toto.

0:57:47.416, 0:57:51.458
Stay on your toes, Toto. No sleeping.

0:57:51.625, 0:57:53.916
We've had enough disasters.

0:57:53.916, 0:57:58.291
Do what poor Alfredo taught you. And God bless you.

0:58:0.0, 0:58:1.833
Thank you, Father.

0:58:1.750, 0:58:7.333
What is this, a funeral? Life goes on! Gaiety! Music!

0:59:42.666, 0:59:44.375
Get a load of that!

0:59:46.541, 0:59:47.708
Our Father...

1:0:8.875, 1:0:11.0
My God, they're kissing!

1:0:16.125, 1:0:18.291
I won't watch pornography.

1:0:24.458, 1:0:26.541
Three cheers for Ciccio!

1:0:57.291, 1:1:0.500
Any room for me in this new paradise?

1:0:59.291, 1:1:0.583
Alfredo!

1:1:5.83, 1:1:7.750
Bring him home after you close.

1:1:8.375, 1:1:10.375
I'm going, Alfredo.

1:1:10.166, 1:1:11.916
It's great you came.

1:1:16.41, 1:1:17.958
How're things at school?

1:1:18.333, 1:1:21.125
Fine, but now that I'm working...

1:1:21.875, 1:1:24.208
maybe I won't go anymore.

1:1:24.41, 1:1:26.375
No. No, Toto.

1:1:27.208, 1:1:28.541
Don't do that.

1:1:29.833, 1:1:32.625
You'll end up with egg on your face.

1:1:32.416, 1:1:34.791
Why? What does that mean?

1:1:35.250, 1:1:36.541
It means...

1:1:39.41, 1:1:41.500
that this isn't your real work.

1:1:43.41, 1:1:45.958
Right now the Paradiso needs you...

1:1:45.875, 1:1:48.166
and you need the Paradiso...

1:1:47.958, 1:1:49.583
but it's a stopgap.

1:1:51.333, 1:1:54.666
One day you'll go on... to other things.

1:1:55.500, 1:1:56.541
Things...

1:1:58.625, 1:2:0.458
that are more important.

1:2:1.333, 1:2:3.625
Definitely more important.

1:2:6.333, 1:2:9.708
I know. Now that I've lost my sight...

1:2:10.375, 1:2:11.708
I see better.

1:2:13.41, 1:2:15.375
Things I never saw before.

1:2:15.250, 1:2:18.625
All thanks to you, who saved my life.

1:2:18.875, 1:2:20.416
I won't forget it.

1:2:21.958, 1:2:23.958
And don't look like that.

1:2:24.916, 1:2:28.83
I'm not senile yet. Want proof?

1:2:28.0, 1:2:30.666
- Yes. - Well, let's see.

1:2:31.83, 1:2:32.416
For example...

1:2:33.333, 1:2:36.583
right now, the film's out of focus.

1:2:36.500, 1:2:37.625
Go check.

1:2:42.291, 1:2:45.125
You're right, it's out of focus.

1:2:45.875, 1:2:47.166
How'd you know?

1:2:49.250, 1:2:51.250
Too hard to explain.

1:3:15.416, 1:3:20.541
What's the idea? Watch the screen. Animals, rapists!

1:3:31.458, 1:3:33.83
Look, don't touch.

1:4:28.250, 1:4:31.208
I told you... it doesn't catch fire.

1:4:35.375, 1:4:38.291
Progress always comes too late.

1:4:45.375, 1:4:47.83
Workers of the world...

1:5:58.250, 1:5:59.541
She's new.

1:6:1.458, 1:6:2.625
Not bad.

1:6:3.375, 1:6:4.583
Approachable.

1:6:4.875, 1:6:9.833
Father's the bank manager. Pride, pomp and circumstance.

1:6:9.83, 1:6:13.541
Jerks off with his shirt, not to get his hand dirty.

1:6:17.333, 1:6:19.291
Go, man, go!

1:6:35.833, 1:6:37.958
- Excuse me. - Yes?

1:6:43.500, 1:6:45.41
You dropped this.

1:6:45.583, 1:6:47.41
Oh, thanks.

1:6:47.333, 1:6:49.416
I didn't even notice.

1:6:51.166, 1:6:54.625
My name's Salvatore. What's yours?

1:6:53.791, 1:6:56.208
Elena. My name's Elena.

1:6:56.291, 1:7:0.958
I wanted to tell you, well, the other day at the station...

1:7:12.833, 1:7:15.750
The small projector? Your footage?

1:7:16.83, 1:7:17.458
What do you see?

1:7:17.666, 1:7:20.666
Slaughterhouse workers killing a heifer.

1:7:21.458, 1:7:24.416
Blood all over the floor, like a lake.

1:7:25.875, 1:7:28.583
Over the lake comes another heifer...

1:7:28.625, 1:7:30.41
about to die.

1:7:37.375, 1:7:40.250
Why'd you stop? What do we see?

1:7:40.541, 1:7:44.791
Nothing. We don't see anything. It's all fuzzy.

1:7:47.83, 1:7:48.83
A woman.

1:7:50.583, 1:7:51.833
It's a woman.

1:7:53.833, 1:7:57.83
Yes, a girl I saw at the station.

1:7:57.458, 1:7:58.833
What's she like?

1:8:0.41, 1:8:1.875
She's very nice.

1:8:2.875, 1:8:6.375
My age, slim, long hair, brown.

1:8:7.500, 1:8:11.166
Big eyes, very blue, honest and direct.

1:8:11.666, 1:8:14.250
A little beauty mark on her lip.

1:8:13.916, 1:8:17.750
Very small. You only see it up close.

1:8:17.541, 1:8:21.625
When she smiles, you feel like... I don't know.

1:8:24.291, 1:8:25.125
Love.

1:8:27.125, 1:8:27.958
Love.

1:8:33.458, 1:8:37.791
I know how it is... The blue-eyed ones are the worst.

1:8:38.791, 1:8:42.791
No matter what you do, they'll never be your friends.

1:8:42.916, 1:8:44.333
Nothing for it.

1:8:44.416, 1:8:47.500
The bigger the man, the deeper his imprint.

1:8:48.375, 1:8:53.125
And if he loves, he suffers, knowing it's a dead-end street.

1:8:54.0, 1:8:56.833
That's nice, what you just said.

1:8:56.625, 1:8:57.791
But sad.

1:8:59.875, 1:9:4.666
I didn't say it. It was John Wayne in "The Shepherd of the Hills".

1:9:5.125, 1:9:6.708
You old pirate.

1:9:37.958, 1:9:40.500
- Hello, Elena. - Hello.

1:9:40.500, 1:9:42.41
Why're you running?

1:9:43.500, 1:9:44.625
Because...

1:9:46.708, 1:9:48.625
I wanted to tell you...

1:9:50.333, 1:9:52.41
you remember when we...

1:9:55.41, 1:9:57.208
Nice day, isn't it?

1:10:2.125, 1:10:4.291
Yes, really nice.

1:10:6.958, 1:10:10.333
Excuse me, I have to go. Bye.

1:10:14.291, 1:10:16.666
What a jerk. What a jerk!

1:10:19.0, 1:10:21.166
"Nice day, isn't it?"

1:10:20.958, 1:10:22.916
Of all the assholes!

1:10:23.958, 1:10:25.500
I told you so.

1:10:25.791, 1:10:27.916
You thought I was joking.

1:10:28.208, 1:10:32.375
But take it from me, the blue-eyed ones are the worst.

1:10:33.666, 1:10:37.833
But why? There must be a way to make her understand.

1:10:37.375, 1:10:42.458
Don't even try. With feelings, there's nothing to understand...

1:10:42.250, 1:10:44.583
and no way to explain.

1:10:44.250, 1:10:46.416
Oh, you made the world!

1:10:45.750, 1:10:48.83
With due respect to the Lord...

1:10:48.791, 1:10:52.83
who made the world in two, three days...

1:10:51.166, 1:10:53.416
I'd have taken a bit longer...

1:10:53.875, 1:10:57.125
but in all modesty, I would've done it better.

1:10:57.0, 1:11:0.583
Like I said... you always have an answer.

1:11:3.41, 1:11:6.708
Just for you, Toto, I'll tell you a story.

1:11:7.958, 1:11:10.0
Let's sit down a minute.

1:11:9.958, 1:11:11.875
Misery of miseries.

1:11:13.833, 1:11:14.916
Once...

1:11:16.833, 1:11:18.916
a king gave a feast...

1:11:19.458, 1:11:22.541
for the loveliest princesses in the realm.

1:11:23.208, 1:11:26.500
Now, a soldier who was standing guard...

1:11:27.541, 1:11:30.125
saw the king's daughter go by.

1:11:30.208, 1:11:32.916
She was the most beautiful of all...

1:11:32.833, 1:11:35.291
and he instantly fell in love.

1:11:36.250, 1:11:38.666
But what is a simple soldier...

1:11:39.125, 1:11:41.416
next to the daughter of a king?

1:11:42.375, 1:11:45.958
Well, at last he succeeded in meeting her...

1:11:47.750, 1:11:51.250
and he told her he could no longer live without her.

1:11:51.625, 1:11:55.500
The princess was so taken by the depth of his feeling...

1:11:56.708, 1:11:59.0
that she said to the soldier...

1:11:59.125, 1:12:0.625
"if you can wait..."

1:12:2.208, 1:12:6.583
"for 100 days and 100 nights under my balcony..."

1:12:7.0, 1:12:9.916
"at the end of it, I shall be yours."

1:12:13.208, 1:12:16.625
With that, the soldier went and waited one day...

1:12:17.750, 1:12:21.83
two days, then ten, then twenty.

1:12:20.750, 1:12:23.625
Each evening the princess looked out...

1:12:24.125, 1:12:25.666
and he never moved!

1:12:26.458, 1:12:31.125
In rain, in wind, in snow, he was always there.

1:12:30.250, 1:12:33.500
Birds shat on his head, bees stung him...

1:12:33.708, 1:12:35.333
but he didn't budge.

1:12:37.250, 1:12:38.416
At the end...

1:12:40.458, 1:12:42.166
of 90 days...

1:12:44.125, 1:12:45.583
he had become...

1:12:48.416, 1:12:50.583
all dry, all white.

1:12:51.750, 1:12:54.291
Tears streamed from his eyes.

1:12:55.583, 1:12:57.708
He couldn't hold them back.

1:12:57.958, 1:13:0.916
He didn't even have the strength to sleep.

1:13:2.250, 1:13:5.625
And all that time, the princess watched him.

1:13:7.625, 1:13:11.333
At long last, it was the 99th night...

1:13:12.291, 1:13:15.375
and the soldier stood up, took his chair...

1:13:17.500, 1:13:18.666
and left.

1:13:19.0, 1:13:20.833
What? At the end?

1:13:22.791, 1:13:24.291
At the very end.

1:13:25.333, 1:13:29.0
And don't ask what it means. I don't know.

1:13:30.833, 1:13:33.750
If you understand it, you tell me.

1:13:48.833, 1:13:50.458
Only one print?

1:13:50.833, 1:13:54.750
You know I need two. One for the Paradiso...

1:13:54.375, 1:13:56.458
one for the next town.

1:13:57.541, 1:14:2.83
You promised. I put up posters, made commitments!

1:14:2.750, 1:14:5.416
If you screw me, watch out!

1:14:4.958, 1:14:7.500
One print for two theaters!

1:14:8.125, 1:14:9.833
You'll pay for this!

1:14:10.0, 1:14:13.416
I'm from Naples, and you will see it and die!

1:14:53.500, 1:14:56.583
We see the crib. The child's asleep.

1:15:16.125, 1:15:18.291
"Do something!"

1:15:21.0, 1:15:23.916
The lawyer told me. Now I know.

1:15:24.208, 1:15:27.125
"The lawyer told me. Now I know."

1:15:28.291, 1:15:32.750
And everyone must know. Yes, everyone must know.

1:15:33.250, 1:15:35.0
"Everyone must know."

1:15:37.416, 1:15:38.750
You believe me?

1:15:40.333, 1:15:41.666
"You believe me?"

1:15:42.41, 1:15:44.250
Yes, I believe you.

1:15:45.83, 1:15:47.291
"Yes, I believe you."

1:15:56.708, 1:15:59.916
Our own home. How I've dreamed of it.

1:15:59.583, 1:16:2.791
- "Our own home." - "How I've dreamed of it."

1:16:10.0, 1:16:11.125
Tonino!

1:16:16.250, 1:16:17.83
Mama.

1:16:19.375, 1:16:20.208
Mama!

1:16:38.416, 1:16:39.416
The End.

1:16:48.791, 1:16:51.500
I don't like it. I don't like it.

1:16:58.666, 1:17:1.708
I cut the end credits to go faster.

1:17:2.166, 1:17:6.333
Hurry back with part one. I'll show a newsreel.

1:17:5.791, 1:17:8.666
I'll call the police. Take him.

1:17:9.791, 1:17:12.416
Just a minute. Just a minute!

1:17:31.291, 1:17:34.500
Give me part two. Here's part one.

1:17:33.750, 1:17:36.250
Hurry, the house is packed.

1:17:39.458, 1:17:42.750
Come on, slowpoke. Get her rolling!

1:17:54.708, 1:17:57.291
Bunch of animals. Quiet!

1:18:19.583, 1:18:22.666
Come on, Toto, they'll explode!

1:18:22.541, 1:18:24.541
It's been a half hour!

1:18:24.833, 1:18:26.166
What can I do?

1:18:28.750, 1:18:32.708
Where is that son of a jackass? I'll be ruined.

1:18:33.500, 1:18:35.958
Calm down, calm down.

1:18:39.500, 1:18:42.708
I'll have you know, just to see this movie...

1:18:42.916, 1:18:45.708
I left my wife homesick in bed...

1:18:46.41, 1:18:48.333
and I haven't seen a thing.

1:18:48.541, 1:18:53.83
If it's not here in ten minutes, give us back our money.

1:18:52.0, 1:18:53.791
Me and everyone here!

1:18:54.416, 1:18:57.208
Or with this, I'll wreck the place!

1:18:59.583, 1:19:3.250
Calm down! Calm down and let me talk.

1:19:4.250, 1:19:8.250
Tell you what. I'll show part one another time.

1:19:13.958, 1:19:15.541
Quiet, quiet!

1:19:17.166, 1:19:21.208
I've seen the whole movie. I'll tell you the plot.

1:20:39.666, 1:20:41.916
Alfredo, what is it?

1:20:42.250, 1:20:45.458
I can't. The Host is on the altar.

1:20:44.625, 1:20:47.375
Father, I need you urgently...

1:20:48.125, 1:20:50.83
because I have doubts...

1:20:50.791, 1:20:53.791
terrible doubts tormenting my soul.

1:20:53.125, 1:20:54.333
Your soul.

1:21:1.41, 1:21:2.875
Father, I've sinned.

1:21:2.291, 1:21:4.666
- Do that after. - But who...

1:21:4.291, 1:21:6.625
Stay there. Don't move.

1:21:6.416, 1:21:9.708
Just act normal. It's Salvatore.

1:21:9.41, 1:21:10.500
How'd you get here?

1:21:14.250, 1:21:17.833
Alfredo, that's a terrible thing to say.

1:21:17.208, 1:21:18.166
I know.

1:21:19.41, 1:21:22.416
But take the miracle of the loaves and fishes.

1:21:22.291, 1:21:23.500
What about it?

1:21:25.83, 1:21:28.166
I always wonder... how is it possible?

1:21:29.250, 1:21:31.208
I had to talk to you.

1:21:40.750, 1:21:42.833
You're beautiful, Elena.

1:21:42.750, 1:21:45.208
That's what I wanted to tell you.

1:21:45.916, 1:21:49.291
When we meet, I can't say anything right...

1:21:50.416, 1:21:52.750
because you give me the shivers.

1:21:53.791, 1:21:57.125
I don't know what others do in these cases.

1:21:58.500, 1:22:0.333
It's my first time.

1:22:1.500, 1:22:3.416
But I'm in love with you.

1:22:3.791, 1:22:5.958
Father, I have sinned.

1:22:6.250, 1:22:9.333
I absolve you, in the name of the Father...

1:22:8.500, 1:22:10.458
Son and Holy Ghost.

1:22:10.0, 1:22:11.500
Go in peace.

1:22:16.416, 1:22:19.125
When you laugh, you're even prettier.

1:22:26.416, 1:22:31.708
Salvatore, you're very sweet, and I like you very much...

1:22:31.291, 1:22:33.41
but I don't love you.

1:22:38.333, 1:22:40.750
I don't care. I'll wait.

1:22:41.125, 1:22:41.875
What?

1:22:42.375, 1:22:44.875
For you to fall in love with me.

1:22:44.708, 1:22:46.0
Now listen.

1:22:47.916, 1:22:52.541
Every night after work, I'll come stand outside your house.

1:22:52.208, 1:22:54.750
And I'll wait. Every night.

1:22:55.291, 1:22:58.666
When you change your mind, open your window.

1:22:58.375, 1:23:1.41
That's all. I'll understand.

1:23:0.666, 1:23:2.416
You understand now?

1:23:2.166, 1:23:5.375
Yes, finally, I see the light.

1:23:10.958, 1:23:13.875
Next time, don't talk heresy.

1:23:15.0, 1:23:17.416
You survived the theater fire,

1:23:17.83, 1:23:21.166
but from the Eternal Fire... that is, Eternal Fire...

1:23:20.458, 1:23:22.541
no one can save you.

1:25:3.541, 1:25:6.333
Fifteen seconds to the new year!

1:25:8.583, 1:25:11.250
14, 13, 12

1:25:12.208, 1:25:15.83
11, 10, 9, 8...

1:26:30.83, 1:26:31.625
Salvatore.

1:28:30.708, 1:28:34.416
Oh, great. Never been driven, he said.

1:28:38.625, 1:28:40.333
How'll we get home?

1:28:42.708, 1:28:43.625
Stop!

1:28:45.916, 1:28:48.333
Oh, God, it's my father.

1:28:50.708, 1:28:52.958
Hello, Mr. Mendola.

1:29:2.708, 1:29:4.458
- Hello. - Hello.

1:29:21.375, 1:29:23.666
Play at an open-air theater.

1:29:36.458, 1:29:38.416
Standing room only!

1:29:46.500, 1:29:49.625
Come on in. The show just started.

1:29:49.41, 1:29:50.875
Have your tickets ready.

1:30:23.208, 1:30:25.541
Salvatore, my love.

1:30:25.750, 1:30:29.291
A whole summer with my family, far from you,

1:30:29.458, 1:30:32.41
my days here go on forever.

1:30:31.875, 1:30:36.541
I see your name everywhere in a book, a crossword puzzle...

1:30:36.416, 1:30:37.791
a newspaper.

1:30:37.833, 1:30:40.625
You're always before my eyes.

1:30:39.416, 1:30:42.833
Today, alas, I have bad news.

1:30:42.583, 1:30:47.875
In October we move to Palermo, where I'll go to university.

1:30:46.875, 1:30:49.916
So we won't see each other every day.

1:30:49.416, 1:30:52.791
But don't worry, whenever I can get away...

1:30:53.166, 1:30:55.958
I'll come to you at the Paradiso.

1:30:58.291, 1:30:59.541
I'm blind!

1:31:15.875, 1:31:19.750
By God's might, by man's running! Rise up!

1:31:47.541, 1:31:50.83
When will this rotten summer end?

1:31:51.750, 1:31:54.666
In a film, it'd already be over.

1:31:54.291, 1:31:58.291
Fade-out: cut to storm. Wouldn't that be great?

1:32:12.541, 1:32:14.500
Tell them I am Odyssey!

1:32:26.916, 1:32:28.833
Elena... But when?

1:32:29.125, 1:32:30.83
Today.

1:32:30.916, 1:32:34.916
You can't imagine the excuses I made up to come here.

1:33:0.333, 1:33:5.125
I'm doing my military service in Rome. I leave Friday.

1:33:4.666, 1:33:8.41
I'll come to say good-bye at the Paradiso.

1:33:7.83, 1:33:10.916
I'll arrive Thursday, by 5 p.m. bus.

1:33:14.375, 1:33:19.541
Maybe the army made a mistake. Anyway, Rome is beautiful.

1:33:20.250, 1:33:24.0
Load the reels for tomorrow, ready for the new man.

1:33:26.250, 1:33:27.875
Hey, cheer up.

1:33:29.125, 1:33:31.875
I'll wait for you. Don't worry.

1:33:31.666, 1:33:33.833
The job'll still be here.

1:33:33.708, 1:33:35.666
I'll wait, you hear?

1:33:35.666, 1:33:37.625
Don't look so gloomy.

1:33:37.125, 1:33:38.958
Come on! Hup!

1:34:19.83, 1:34:24.333
Radioman Di Vita, 3rd Battalion, 9th Company, sir!

1:34:24.958, 1:34:29.750
Transferred her father? No way! And no one knows where?

1:34:30.625, 1:34:35.250
Screw you if you won't tell me! Asshole son of a bitch!

1:36:25.208, 1:36:26.333
You're thinner.

1:36:27.833, 1:36:29.916
Put you through it, eh?

1:36:30.541, 1:36:33.41
They tell me you never go out...

1:36:33.0, 1:36:35.500
and you never talk to anybody.

1:36:34.958, 1:36:35.833
Why?

1:36:37.416, 1:36:39.333
You know how it is.

1:36:40.416, 1:36:43.333
Sooner or later the time comes...

1:36:43.625, 1:36:46.83
whether you talk or don't talk...

1:36:47.0, 1:36:48.625
it's the same thing.

1:36:50.750, 1:36:53.125
So you might as well shut up.

1:37:0.166, 1:37:1.500
It's hot here.

1:37:3.333, 1:37:5.250
Take me to the sea.

1:37:5.250, 1:37:9.416
At a party, a lieutenant pinches this girl's ass.

1:37:8.916, 1:37:12.416
She turns around. It's the colonel's daughter.

1:37:12.875, 1:37:15.708
Terrified, the lieutenant says...

1:37:14.750, 1:37:19.625
"if your heart is as hard as what I just felt, I'm a dead man."

1:37:25.958, 1:37:27.625
You haven't seen her?

1:37:29.500, 1:37:30.250
No.

1:37:31.500, 1:37:34.125
And no one knows where she is.

1:37:35.750, 1:37:38.541
Probably that's how it was meant to be.

1:37:39.791, 1:37:43.83
We, each of us, have a star to follow.

1:37:45.83, 1:37:46.458
Get out of here.

1:37:47.333, 1:37:49.250
This land is cursed.

1:37:50.333, 1:37:52.625
Living here day by day...

1:37:53.416, 1:37:56.125
you think it's the center of the world.

1:37:57.83, 1:38:0.0
You believe nothing will ever change.

1:38:1.0, 1:38:3.958
Then you leave... a year, two years.

1:38:4.791, 1:38:8.41
When you come back, everything's changed.

1:38:7.458, 1:38:9.125
The thread's broken.

1:38:10.333, 1:38:12.833
What you came to find isn't there.

1:38:13.125, 1:38:15.208
What was yours is gone.

1:38:15.291, 1:38:18.250
You have to go away for a long time...

1:38:19.83, 1:38:20.500
many years...

1:38:21.416, 1:38:24.791
before you can come back and find your people.

1:38:26.583, 1:38:28.791
The land where you were born.

1:38:30.125, 1:38:33.250
But now, no. It's not possible.

1:38:32.416, 1:38:35.166
Right now you're blinder than I am.

1:38:35.250, 1:38:40.583
Who said that? Gary Cooper? James Stewart? Henry Fonda?

1:38:39.250, 1:38:40.833
No, Toto.

1:38:43.458, 1:38:45.0
Nobody said it.

1:38:47.333, 1:38:49.333
This time it's all me.

1:38:50.875, 1:38:53.541
Life isn't like in the movies.

1:38:54.750, 1:38:55.791
Life...

1:38:57.125, 1:38:58.625
is much harder.

1:39:0.708, 1:39:2.83
Get out of here.

1:39:2.958, 1:39:5.708
Go back to Rome. You're young...

1:39:6.208, 1:39:8.0
the world is yours.

1:39:9.458, 1:39:10.791
And I'm old.

1:39:12.416, 1:39:15.291
I don't want to hear you talk anymore.

1:39:15.750, 1:39:18.208
I want to hear talk about you.

1:40:36.708, 1:40:38.208
Don't come back.

1:40:39.875, 1:40:41.791
Don't think about us.

1:40:41.958, 1:40:44.541
Don't look back. Don't write.

1:40:44.958, 1:40:48.666
Don't give in to nostalgia. Forget us all.

1:40:50.583, 1:40:54.500
If you do and you come back, don't come see me.

1:40:54.0, 1:40:57.708
I won't let you in my house. Understand?

1:41:4.666, 1:41:5.791
Thank you.

1:41:7.708, 1:41:10.208
For everything you've done for me.

1:41:12.708, 1:41:15.625
Whatever you end up doing, love it.

1:41:17.375, 1:41:20.166
The way you loved the projection booth...

1:41:21.541, 1:41:23.791
when you were a little squirt.

1:41:32.541, 1:41:35.791
He's left. Toto! Good-bye!

1:41:43.375, 1:41:46.125
Got here too late, what a shame.

1:42:45.291, 1:42:47.625
It's Toto. I knew it.

1:43:22.833, 1:43:25.333
See how nice the house is?

1:43:25.333, 1:43:28.541
We had it all redone, all thanks to you.

1:43:30.583, 1:43:33.666
I have a surprise for you. Come.

1:43:34.458, 1:43:35.750
Are you tired?

1:43:37.166, 1:43:40.166
You have time to rest before the funeral.

1:43:40.208, 1:43:43.833
No, Mama, it's only an hour by plane.

1:43:44.333, 1:43:47.583
Don't tell me that after all these years.

1:43:47.791, 1:43:52.291
Come. I put everything in here. All your things.

1:45:39.416, 1:45:42.250
He must be glad you came, Toto.

1:45:44.458, 1:45:48.83
He always talked about you. Always.

1:45:49.0, 1:45:50.833
Right up to the end.

1:45:54.333, 1:45:57.208
He really... He really loved you.

1:46:12.833, 1:46:15.83
He left something for you.

1:46:16.625, 1:46:18.166
Before you leave...

1:46:18.833, 1:46:20.208
come see me.

1:47:54.625, 1:47:56.83
How have you been?

1:48:6.291, 1:48:8.541
When did you close it down?

1:48:9.83, 1:48:13.291
Six years ago in May. Nobody came anymore.

1:48:13.708, 1:48:20.83
You know better than I, Mr. Di Vita... the economy, TV, videos.

1:48:19.583, 1:48:22.833
The old movie business is just a memory.

1:48:23.916, 1:48:27.125
The city bought the site for a parking lot.

1:48:28.166, 1:48:31.791
They're demolishing it Saturday. It's too bad.

1:48:34.208, 1:48:36.625
What's this "Mr. Di Vita"?

1:48:37.208, 1:48:39.625
You used to order me around.

1:48:39.333, 1:48:42.916
Now that you're a big shot, it's a little different.

1:48:44.333, 1:48:46.958
But, if you insist, Toto.

1:48:50.958, 1:48:52.375
Excuse me.

1:48:57.708, 1:49:0.666
Who would've believed it... little Toto.

1:49:16.666, 1:49:19.583
This is... what he left for you.

1:49:21.958, 1:49:24.125
He never asked to see me?

1:49:23.541, 1:49:24.916
No, never.

1:49:28.208, 1:49:30.458
Once your mother said to him...

1:49:31.375, 1:49:34.500
that if he wanted it, you'd surely come.

1:49:36.333, 1:49:39.458
He was furious. He said, "No."

1:49:39.958, 1:49:44.291
"Toto must never come back to Giancaldo!"

1:49:46.291, 1:49:48.625
He didn't say it to be mean.

1:49:48.791, 1:49:50.666
He was a good man.

1:49:51.875, 1:49:54.750
Who knows what was going through his head.

1:49:56.208, 1:49:59.875
Towards the end, he said strange things.

1:50:3.41, 1:50:6.125
A moment before he closed his eyes...

1:50:7.333, 1:50:10.583
he told your mothers he mustn't let you know.

1:54:21.708, 1:54:23.250
What're you thinking?

1:54:27.291, 1:54:30.708
Just that I've always been afraid to come back.

1:54:34.833, 1:54:39.500
And now, after all these years, I thought I was stronger...

1:54:39.875, 1:54:42.541
that I'd forgotten a lot of things.

1:54:43.208, 1:54:44.583
But in fact...

1:54:45.916, 1:54:48.916
I find I'm right back where I was...

1:54:48.500, 1:54:50.791
as if I'd never been away.

1:54:53.250, 1:54:57.83
Yet when I look around, I don't recognize anyone.

1:55:0.166, 1:55:1.541
And you, Mama...

1:55:3.416, 1:55:4.916
I deserted you.

1:55:6.500, 1:55:9.0
Ran out on you like a bandit...

1:55:8.708, 1:55:10.875
without any explanation.

1:55:10.875, 1:55:13.0
I never asked for any.

1:55:12.666, 1:55:15.166
You don't have to explain to me.

1:55:15.291, 1:55:19.666
I always thought it was good what you did. Why harp on it?

1:55:21.0, 1:55:22.875
You were right to leave.

1:55:23.333, 1:55:25.625
You did what you wanted to do.

1:55:28.625, 1:55:32.458
When I call you, a different woman always answers.

1:55:34.375, 1:55:37.458
But I never heard in any of their voices...

1:55:38.166, 1:55:40.291
that they really loved you.

1:55:40.416, 1:55:41.875
I would've known.

1:55:42.708, 1:55:45.416
All the same, I'd have liked...

1:55:44.958, 1:55:46.583
to see you settled...

1:55:49.500, 1:55:51.0
loving someone.

1:55:52.541, 1:55:54.375
But your life is there.

1:55:54.833, 1:55:57.291
Here there are only ghosts.

1:55:57.958, 1:55:59.666
Let go, Toto.

1:57:26.750, 1:57:29.333
It's my square. It's mine.

1:58:0.958, 1:58:3.958
Check the leader. Roll when you're ready.

1:58:4.375, 1:58:8.250
Right. And I liked your film. Terrific.

1:58:7.333, 1:58:8.416
Thanks.
