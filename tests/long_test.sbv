In this video i'm going to describe how the text to speech addon works

00:00:09.708, 00:00:12.958
Firstly, we need to install the addon

00:00:12.958, 00:00:21.750
If you're using Windows, you will need to right click blender and click run as administrator, just this one time

00:00:21.750, 00:00:29.708
We can install the addon by opening the preferences in Blender, and installing the Text to Speech zip file

00:00:29.708, 00:00:35.00
It might take a moment to install the google text to speech library

00:00:35.916, 00:00:42.41
When you navigate to the video editing interface you should see the Text to Speech tab

00:00:43.41, 00:00:49.583
If it doesn't appear, you can toggle the system console to see any errors in Windows

00:00:50.583, 00:00:55.541
In linux you can open blender from a terminal to see the output

00:00:56.541, 00:00:59.250
Let me know if you have any issues

00:01:00.250, 00:01:07.666
You can make individual audio strips by typing something in the text field and pressing speechify

00:01:08.666, 00:01:15.666
Alternatively you can import a closed caption file and it will convert all the strips to audio

00:01:16.666, 00:01:21.125
Accent can be chosen before speechify or file import

00:01:22.125, 00:01:29.125
Currently only text files, s.r.t and s.b.v files are supported

00:01:30.125, 00:01:35.583
If time codes are provided, audio strips will be placed at that time

00:01:36.583, 00:01:42.375
In the case of txt files, audio strips will be placed one after another

00:01:43.375, 00:01:52.333
After importing, you can move the audio strips around, delete them, and mix with individual audio strips

00:01:53.333, 00:02:03.41
You can then export closed caption files and it will export an updated file that corresponds to your current audio strips

00:02:04.41, 00:02:12.375
You can save blender, reopen and it will remember the text associated with the audio strips for further editing

00:02:13.375, 00:02:15.00
Thanks for watching
