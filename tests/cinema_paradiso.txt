terrible doubts tormenting my soul.

Well? How much is 5 times 5?

30.

Table of 5's, dimwit.

1 times 5 is 5...

4 times 5 is 20...

40.

Silence!

25.

Learn your tables, or you'll never get a job.

Christmas!

Get down from there, you devil.

Go back to your seat.

Little monsters.

I'm off to Oregon.

A star-studded cast...

Claire Trevor...

Hello, everyone!

- Can't I say hello? - Double feature today.

So? I'm here to sleep.

- What's your smoke? - Americans.

Cut the news, Alfredo!

The men and women who fought in secret...

brave guerrillas, reunited in Rome...

for the first Resistance Rally.

What does it say?

I'm illiterate.

You, too?

Twelve hours of blood and sweat...

Yet their nets...

when they pulled them up, were full.

I knew it!

Twenty years I've gone to movies and never saw a kiss.

You spent it on movies?

Movies, always movies!

Leave him alone. Go easy.

And you, why do you tell lies?

You know you got in free.

Tell your mother.

Maybe he lost the money inside.

- How much? - 50 lire.

A comb.

Two shoe lifts.

- Can of tobacco... - And?

50 lire.

See?

Thank you, Alfredo.

- Good-bye. - Bye.

See you.

The square is mine! It's my square!

It's midnight. Midnight!

Out! Shoo! I have to close the square.

Hard on the feet, eh, Father?

Going, it's all downhill and all the saints help out.

But coming back, the saints just watch.

See you tonight.

Your foot this time.

Always something. What can we do?

Alfredo, did you know my father?

What a question. And how I knew him.

Tall, thin, jolly, with a nice mustache like me.

Always smiling. A lot like Clark Gable.

I don't say I should come in the booth...

but can't we at least be friends?

"I choose my friends for looks, my enemies for intelligence."

You're too foxy to be my friend.

I always tell my children...

"Be careful how you choose your friends."

When I do, I'll tell them.

The fire's out. It's over. I'm here.

What happened?

Monster!

Your little sister could've burned to death.

And all your fault!

I told you not to keep your film under the bed by the fire pan.

Nearly set fire to the house.

You and your stupid movies!

Aren't you ashamed at your age to play with a boy?

Why look at me? What did I do?

He's dead.

That's not true.

You'll see, he'll come back.

They smoke like chimneys.

No. Go buy a ticket.

No!

What was that?

I'll make mincemeat of you! You'll reckon with me!

Signora Anna!

Don't blame me. Your wife told me to bring your lunch.

I told my mother you didn't give me the film.

It wasn't your fault.

I thought it was a joke about film catching fire.

I just wanted to tell you. Now I'll go.

Toto, come here.

Come on, come sit down.

Now listen. I got into this business at age ten.

Back then, we didn't have fancy machines.

Movies were silent.

You turned the projector by hand...

with a crank.

The whole livelong day!

And it was hard, that damn crank.

If you got tired and slowed down a bit...

So why not teach me?

Now that there's no crank and it's dead easy.

Because I don't want to.

It's no kind of job for you.

You're like a slave...

and always alone.

You see a film 100 times. You've nothing else to do.

You talk to Garbo and Tyrone Power like a loony bird.

You work like a burro.

Even holidays... Easter, Christmas.

You only get Good Friday off.

And if they hadn't stuck Christ on a cross...

we'd even work then.

So why don't you change jobs?

Because I'm a nitwit.

Nobody. It takes an imbecile like me.

And I never had any luck.

So! Want to be a stick-in-the-mud like me? How about it?

Atta boy, Toto.

I'm telling the manager not to let you in!

And I'll see Father Adelfio! No more altar boy! Finished!

Up yours!

I got it! I won! I won the football lottery!

The Neapolitan won the lottery!

Hey, Ciccio from Naples won the lottery!

Always the northerners who hit it lucky.

The square is mine! All mine!

You got a lice factory up here.

Beat it.

What're you after? A smack?

Get out of here.

A merchant owns two stores.

In one, he sells fruit.

Be seated.

Professor...

Silence!

Rotten little stinker.

- Toto, help me. - Silence!

I can't do this damn thing.

Toto!

O.K.

you're under arrest.

Kiss my ass! Pencil pusher!

Right here is where it can catch fire.

If it does, cut here and here, or the whole reel will burn. Got it?

Yes. Alfredo.

Never. We'll never have that here.

Which side is the gelatin on?

Shipping invoice for the film. Always keep them.

I will, Alfredo.

Don't ever forget.

This is for you. Today you load the reels yourself.

- It's so high! - Now you can run it alone.

Hold it.

Say good-bye to Peppino. He's leaving for Germany.

My father says he's a communist.

God keep you, Mama.

Will he really find work in Germany?

You never know. Like playing the lottery...

you live on hope.

Screw this country!

Good-bye, Mama.

Good-bye, Peppino! Come back soon!

We'll see you.

Good-bye!

has released a new list of Italian dead...

until now considered missing.

Families concerned will be notified.

However, we don't know where he's buried.

Here's the pension form. Sign it, please.

Out! Go home! We can't have another show!

It's late. Be reasonable. We can't show it again!

Some peoples at through it twice!

Tomorrow we'll have another movie.

A western. Word of Honor! Go home to bed.

They'll wreck the Paradiso! All hell will break loose!

Alfredo, let us in!

What can I do?

I've been waiting for three hours!

"A mob doesn't think.

It has a mind of its own."

Well, what do you say?

Shall we let the poor devils see their film?

Fantastic. But how?

"If you have no faith in me, have faith in what you see."

Now get your fanny off that stool.

Get ready.

and we pass through walls.

Alfredo, it's beautiful.

Over there! It's the movie!

Bravo, Alfredo.

Thank you, Alfredo!

What's going on?

It's a movie!

There's no sound!

Shall we make them happy?

Want to go down?

Go on.

- Look. - Good Lord.

And Nunzio, half price.

Reduced rates.

Oh, no!

The square is mine! Don't joke about that! It makes me mad!

Alfredo!

Alfredo! No! Alfredo!

Alfredo, Alfredo. Help! Help!

Alfredo, Alfredo!

Poor Alfredo. What a shame.

All burned!

It all burned down!

What do we do now?

Don't ask me how their minds work.

Officially, I'm the projectionist, but the money goes to Toto.

Stay on your toes, Toto. No sleeping.

We've had enough disasters.

Do what poor Alfredo taught you. And God bless you.

Thank you, Father.

What is this, a funeral? Life goes on! Gaiety! Music!

Get a load of that!

I won't watch pornography.

Three cheers for Ciccio!

Any room for me in this new paradise?

Alfredo!

Bring him home after you close.

I'm going, Alfredo.

It's great you came.

How're things at school?

maybe I won't go anymore.

No. No, Toto.

Don't do that.

You'll end up with egg on your face.

Why? What does that mean?

It means...

Right now the Paradiso needs you...

I see better.

I wanted to tell you, well, the other day at the station...

The small projector? Your footage?

What do you see?

Slaughterhouse workers killing a heifer.

Blood all over the floor, like a lake.

Over the lake comes another heifer...

about to die.

Why'd you stop? What do we see?

It's a woman.

Yes, a girl I saw at the station.

What's she like?

She's very nice.

My age, slim, long hair, brown.

Big eyes, very blue, honest and direct.

A little beauty mark on her lip.

Very small. You only see it up close.

When she smiles, you feel like... I don't know.

Love.

Love.

I know how it is... The blue-eyed ones are the worst.

No matter what you do, they'll never be your friends.

Nothing for it.

The bigger the man, the deeper his imprint.

That's nice, what you just said.

But sad.

"Nice day, isn't it?"

But take it from me, the blue-eyed ones are the worst.

But why? There must be a way to make her understand.

and no way to explain.

Oh, you made the world!

With due respect to the Lord...

who made the world in two, three days...

I'd have taken a bit longer...

but in all modesty, I would've done it better.

Like I said... you always have an answer.

Just for you, Toto, I'll tell you a story.

Let's sit down a minute.

Misery of miseries.

Once...

for the loveliest princesses in the realm.

Now, a soldier who was standing guard...

saw the king's daughter go by.

She was the most beautiful of all...

and he instantly fell in love.

But what is a simple soldier...

next to the daughter of a king?

and he told her he could no longer live without her.

Each evening the princess looked out...

and he never moved!

he had become...

And don't ask what it means. I don't know.

One print for two theaters!

Tonino!

Mama.

Mama!

I don't like it. I don't like it.

I cut the end credits to go faster.

Just a minute. Just a minute!

Give me part two. Here's part one.

Hurry, the house is packed.

Come on, slowpoke. Get her rolling!

Bunch of animals. Quiet!

Come on, Toto, they'll explode!

It's been a half hour!

What can I do?

Where is that son of a jackass? I'll be ruined.

Calm down, calm down.

I'll have you know, just to see this movie...

I left my wife homesick in bed...

and I haven't seen a thing.

If it's not here in ten minutes, give us back our money.

Me and everyone here!

Or with this, I'll wreck the place!

Tell you what. I'll show part one another time.

I can't. The Host is on the altar.

Father, I need you urgently...

because I have doubts...

Father, I've sinned.

- Do that after. - But who...

Just act normal. It's Salvatore.

How'd you get here?

Alfredo, that's a terrible thing to say.

I know.

But take the miracle of the loaves and fishes.

What about it?

I always wonder... how is it possible?

I had to talk to you.

You're beautiful, Elena.

I don't know what others do in these cases.

It's my first time.

But I'm in love with you.

Father, I have sinned.

I absolve you, in the name of the Father...

Son and Holy Ghost.

When you laugh, you're even prettier.

but I don't love you.

For you to fall in love with me.

Now listen.

Every night after work, I'll come stand outside your house.

When you change your mind, open your window.

That's all. I'll understand.

You understand now?

Yes, finally, I see the light.

Next time, don't talk heresy.

You survived the theater fire,

no one can save you.

Fifteen seconds to the new year!

Oh, great. Never been driven, he said.

Stop!

Oh, God, it's my father.

Have your tickets ready.

Salvatore, my love.

A whole summer with my family, far from you,

my days here go on forever.

I see your name everywhere in a book, a crossword puzzle...

a newspaper.

You're always before my eyes.

Today, alas, I have bad news.

But don't worry, whenever I can get away...

In a film, it'd already be over.

You can't imagine the excuses I made up to come here.

I'm doing my military service in Rome. I leave Friday.

I'll arrive Thursday, by 5 p.m. bus.

Load the reels for tomorrow, ready for the new man.

Hey, cheer up.

The job'll still be here.

Don't look so gloomy.

Come on! Hup!

You're thinner.

Put you through it, eh?

You know how it is.

Sooner or later the time comes...

it's the same thing.

It's hot here.

Take me to the sea.

She turns around. It's the colonel's daughter.

"if your heart is as hard as what I just felt, I'm a dead man."

You haven't seen her?

Get out of here.

you think it's the center of the world.

When you come back, everything's changed.

What was yours is gone.

before you can come back and find your people.

Right now you're blinder than I am.

Nobody said it.

Life...

Go back to Rome. You're young...

I don't want to hear you talk anymore.

Don't think about us.

If you do and you come back, don't come see me.

For everything you've done for me.

when you were a little squirt.

It's Toto. I knew it.

I have a surprise for you. Come.

No, Mama, it's only an hour by plane.

He must be glad you came, Toto.

He really... He really loved you.

come see me.

Six years ago in May. Nobody came anymore.

The city bought the site for a parking lot.

Screw you if you won't tell me! Asshole son of a bitch!

Maybe the army made a mistake. Anyway, Rome is beautiful.

I'll wait, you hear?

Transferred her father? No way! And no one knows where?

Why?

So you might as well shut up.

Today.

They tell me you never go out...

whether you talk or don't talk...

Radioman Di Vita, 3rd Battalion, 9th Company, sir!

I'll come to say good-bye at the Paradiso.

and you never talk to anybody.

I'll wait for you. Don't worry.

What a jerk. What a jerk!

Our Father...

Nothing. We don't see anything. It's all fuzzy.

Calm down! Calm down and let me talk.

Stay there. Don't move.

When we meet, I can't say anything right...

Go in peace.

but from the Eternal Fire... that is, Eternal Fire...

because you give me the shivers.

And I'll wait. Every night.

My God, they're kissing!

That's what I wanted to tell you.

I'm blind!

Tell them I am Odyssey!

a king gave a feast...

to bring home barely enough to keep from starving.

What'd you find tonight, under the seats?

If that's God's will.

You haven't got any children.

Alfredo.

like a shot, whom, everything burned.

Who else around here could run a projector?

Hold still! Horseflies bothering you?

Francesco Messana...

- What a build! - My turn!

We've been waiting for an hour!

Abracadabra...

Have to buy tickets, folks.

that this isn't your real work.

And if he loves, he suffers, knowing it's a dead-end street.

that she said to the soldier...

"for 100 days and 100 nights under my balcony..."

You thought I was joking.

The princess was so taken by the depth of his feeling...

Too hard to explain.

We see the crib. The child's asleep.

"Do something!"

I'm from Naples, and you will see it and die!

Approachable.

With that, the soldier went and waited one day...

At the end...

"The lawyer told me. Now I know."

two days, then ten, then twenty.

Birds shat on his head, bees stung him...

"Yes, I believe you."

Play at an open-air theater.

Probably that's how it was meant to be.

In rain, in wind, in snow, he was always there.

And when will we?

Of all the assholes!

Well, at last he succeeded in meeting her...

"at the end of it, I shall be yours."

but he didn't budge.

of 90 days...

all dry, all white.

He couldn't hold them back.

He didn't even have the strength to sleep.

And all that time, the princess watched him.

At long last, it was the 99th night...

and the soldier stood up, took his chair...

and left.

What? At the end?

At the very end.

If you understand it, you tell me.

Only one print?

one for the next town.

You promised. I put up posters, made commitments!

If you screw me, watch out!

And everyone must know. Yes, everyone must know.

You believe me?

"You believe me?"

Yes, I believe you.

Our own home. How I've dreamed of it.

- "Our own home." - "How I've dreamed of it."

Hurry back with part one. I'll show a newsreel.

Salvatore, you're very sweet, and I like you very much...

How'll we get home?

Hello, Mr. Mendola.

- Hello. - Hello.

Standing room only!

Come on in. The show just started.

No.

And no one knows where she is.

We, each of us, have a star to follow.

Good-for-nothing! Get in there and study!

Silence!

2 times 5 is 10...

5 times 5?

Boccia...

For the last time...

I paid to get in. I'm seeing the movie.

Worse than rabbits. They're all over the place.

Wait for me at my ranch.

featuring John Wayne...

Kiss my ass!

- Don Vincenzo. - You and you, to work.

What about me?

His day will come, even here. You watch.

I always get left out.

Good movie. The kid really acted well.

What a jackass to buy that boat.

Idiot, you didn't get it at all.

Right, boys, you work from dawn to dusk.

Mama.

I waited all day. You got milk?

No.

Stolen.

Signora Maria, wait.

What's wrong?

Now that I'm older and go to fifth grade...

Don't cry, don't cry. It's all right.

Who gave him the film?

Don't do it again. He goes crazy. Crazy!

All I hear is movies, Alfredo.

Swear you won't let him in again. Swear it!

You have my word.

God grant me this.

Papa won't come back, and I know why.

Cooped up here. Suffocate in summer, freeze to death in winter.

Breathing fumes.

And you earn chicken feed.

Oh, it grows on you.

Sometimes you listen...

and the house is full of people...

Then you're happy too.

It makes you feel good to hear them.

Like you're the one who made them laugh...

That part I like.

I might as well speak Greek! What're you up to?

Pretend to listen, then play the clown!

How'd the rascal do it? He learned by watching.

Why don't you say good-bye?

Lucky thing Germany is closer than Russia.

After six years, the return of spring fashion.

Fresh and breezy...

I'll make mincemeat of you!

"You'll reckon with me!"

Another sad page...

The Defense Ministry...

Up yours! The square belongs to everyone!

We have no more entertainment. Nothing.

Where'll we get the money to rebuild?

Take a look at Ciccio. So spiffy, you'd hardly know him.

The new Cinema Paradiso!

Come in, come in.

This theater is for you!

I got the license through connections.

but it's a stopgap.

One day you'll go on... to other things.

Things...

that are more important.

Definitely more important.

I know. Now that I've lost my sight...

Things I never saw before.

All thanks to you, who saved my life.

I won't forget it.

And don't look like that.

I'm not senile yet. Want proof?

- Yes. - Well, let's see.

For example...

right now, the film's out of focus.

Go check.

You're right, it's out of focus.

How'd you know?

What's the idea? Watch the screen. Animals, rapists!

Look, don't touch.

I told you... it doesn't catch fire.

Workers of the world...

She's new.

Not bad.

Father's the bank manager. Pride, pomp and circumstance.

Jerks off with his shirt, not to get his hand dirty.

Go, man, go!

You dropped this.

Oh, thanks.

I didn't even notice.

Elena. My name's Elena.

I didn't say it. It was John Wayne in "The Shepherd of the Hills".

You old pirate.

- Hello, Elena. - Hello.

Why're you running?

Because...

I wanted to tell you...

Nice day, isn't it?

Yes, really nice.

Excuse me, I have to go. Bye.

I told you so.

Don't even try. With feelings, there's nothing to understand...

Tears streamed from his eyes.

"Everyone must know."

Your soul.

Terrified, the lieutenant says...

This land is cursed.

You believe nothing will ever change.

The thread's broken.

You have to go away for a long time...

The land where you were born.

Who said that? Gary Cooper? James Stewart? Henry Fonda?

This time it's all me.

is much harder.

the world is yours.

I want to hear talk about you.

Don't look back. Don't write.

I won't let you in my house. Understand?

Whatever you end up doing, love it.

He's left. Toto! Good-bye!

See how nice the house is?

Are you tired?

Don't tell me that after all these years.

He always talked about you. Always.

He left something for you.

How have you been?

You know better than I, Mr. Di Vita... the economy, TV, videos.

you remember when we...

You'll pay for this!

Go get a job from Stalin.

Too bad he was so unlucky.

And don't ask how much it pays.

The money?

I understood right away.

Even the photographs burned!

Alfredo, movies!

Send your father home to whip you!

I only tell you for your own good.

Don't you like anything about it?

giggling and laughing.

who made them forget their troubles.

Your mother's right! You're a scatterbrain!

Alfredo!

the auditors taking the exam for the grade school diploma.

Good riddance!

It tastes good.

Go work in Germany, you and your Stalin.

unlike the pompous styles of wartime.

in the tragedy of our men in Russia.

The names will be posted by local military authorities.

A woman.

Spencer Tracy said that in "Fury."

Go look out the window.

To hell with you.

Help!

Who has that kind of money?

He's just a boy. What about labor laws?

They're demolishing it Saturday. It's too bad.

Get your diploma and join the police! Lazybones!

What's this "Mr. Di Vita"?

You can hoodwink your mother, but not me!

You used to order me around.

Go to bed. It's late.

Now that you're a big shot, it's a little different.

It takes years to get there and years to come back.

But, if you insist, Toto.

Where's Russia?

Excuse me.

I don't remember him.

Who would've believed it... little Toto.

He'll come back, you'll see. One of these days.

This is... what he left for you.

Mama, the war's over, but... why doesn't Papa come back?

He never asked to see me?

or I'll smash your face in."

Fine, but now that I'm working...

No, never.

"Black hearted pig, stay away from me...

Once your mother said to him...

"Hey, you! Dirty swine, hands off that gold!"

that if he wanted it, you'd surely come.

"This is no job for weaklings, traitorous dog."

He was furious. He said, "No."

"Shoot first, think later."

and you need the Paradiso...

"Toto must never come back to Giancaldo!"

Don't come back, or I'll thrash you!

He didn't say it to be mean.

If they're mine, how come you keep them?

He was a good man.

What kind of a deal is that?

Who knows what was going through his head.

Right. Then we agree. Now scram.

Towards the end, he said strange things.

All right.

A moment before he closed his eyes...

But one, you keep out of here, and two, they stay with me. Got it?

he told your mothers he mustn't let you know.

Thanks.

What're you thinking?

All those are yours... a present.

Just that I've always been afraid to come back.

Before I kick your fanny, I'll make you a deal.

And now, after all these years, I thought I was stronger...

No. Now look, come here.

that I'd forgotten a lot of things.

Then I can have them.

But in fact...

Anyway, they kiss too much.

Progress always comes too late.

I find I'm right back where I was...

Sometimes I can't find the right place, so they stay here.

as if I'd never been away.

Why didn't you splice these when you gave the films back?

Yet when I look around, I don't recognize anyone.

What a pest you are!

And you, Mama...

I have to splice it back before I return the film.

- Excuse me. - Yes?

I deserted you.

Deaf as a post!

Ran out on you like a bandit...

- Well, can I? - No!

My name's Salvatore. What's yours?

without any explanation.

Come on, can I have it?

I never asked for any.

Can I have it?

You don't have to explain to me.

Like that.

I always thought it was good what you did. Why harp on it?

One day, I'll cut it off.

You were right to leave.

Like to wag your tongue, eh?

You did what you wanted to do.

"And turn into a chunk of charcoal."

When I call you, a different woman always answers.

little as you are, you'll go up... boom!

But I never heard in any of their voices...

If the film catches fire...

that they really loved you.

I told you and told you... like talking to a wall.

I would've known.

You mustn't come here.

All the same, I'd have liked...

100 lire! Real nylon!

to see you settled...

One pair, two pairs!

loving someone.

Never!

But your life is there.

You don't love me anymore.

Here there are only ghosts.

Forget it.

Let go, Toto.

where no one knows us.

It's my square. It's mine.

live the easy life...

Check the leader. Roll when you're ready.

We'll go away together...

Right. And I liked your film. Terrific.

Pepe, one day we'll have it all.

Thanks.

The frame!

Here we go again.

You can start.

Yes!

Alfredo!

Alfredo.

I want to! I want to!

- Yes, yes! - Toto, out!

- Can I come? - No, you cannot.

Now run along home. I've something to do.

I know why you're tired. Don't think I don't.

The veterinarian says so. That's why I'm tired.

Father, at my house we don't even eat at noon.

Always sleeping. What do you do at night, eat?

How often must I say it? Without the bell, I lose my place.

Better late than never.

Cleanse me from my sin.

Toto!

Cleanse...

Cleanse...

Lord God, we ask you to be pleased with the sacrifice we offer you with humble and contrite heart.

The boy will be my death. How can I say Mass?

No. Go to sleep.

Who is he, a relative?

The funeral is tomorrow.

She said someone's died... someone named Alfredo.

No.

She called just to say that?

When she wants to see you, she comes to Rome.

She said you haven't visited her in 30 years.

We had a long talk.

I played along.I didn't want to disappoint her.

What'd you tell her?

She took me for someone else.

Your mother called.

Go back to sleep.

I'm sorry. There was no way to let you know.

Very late.

what time is it?

Salvatore...

I'm his mother.

I'd like to talk to Mr. Salvatore DE Vita.

If he finds out later we didn't tell him, he'll be angry.

I'm sure he'll remember. I know him better than you.

He'll remember.

You know how he is.

He hasn't been here in 30 years.

Come on, let it go.

He won't remember anymore.

He's a busy man, could be anywhere.

Mama, it's useless to call.

Thank you. Good-bye.

656-220-56.

Then please, can you tell me...

I see, not there.

I'm calling from Sicily, the whole blessed day.

Yes, that's it. I'm his mother.

What do you mean you don't know him?

Yes, Salvatore. Salvatore DE Vita.

I'll call the police. Take him.

Elena... But when?

In October we move to Palermo, where I'll go to university.

3 times 5 is 15...

Life isn't like in the movies.

many years...

Thank you.

Come. I put everything in here. All your things.

You know I need two. One for the Paradiso...

When will this rotten summer end?

I'll come to you at the Paradiso.

By God's might, by man's running! Rise up!

I've seen the whole movie. I'll tell you the plot.

Alfredo, what is it?

I don't care. I'll wait.

What?

14, 13, 12

11, 10, 9, 8...

Salvatore.

Quiet, quiet!

"if you can wait..."

The lawyer told me. Now I know.

The End.

At a party, a lieutenant pinches this girl's ass.

So we won't see each other every day.

Living here day by day...

Then you leave... a year, two years.

No, Toto.

Got here too late, what a shame.

Before you leave...

what is 5 times 5?

Get out of here.

And I'm old.

We had it all redone, all thanks to you.

When did you close it down?

Don't come back.

What you came to find isn't there.

Don't give in to nostalgia. Forget us all.

You have time to rest before the funeral.

The old movie business is just a memory.

Wait for a dead man?

But now, no. It's not possible.

The way you loved the projection booth...

Right up to the end.

Fade-out: cut to storm. Wouldn't that be great?
